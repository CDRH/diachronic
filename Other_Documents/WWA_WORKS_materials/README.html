		</div>
		<p>The system that the Whitman Archive worked out to indicate relationships among various
			instances of a given work was developed in 2000 and 2001, just as we were beginning to
			do TEI (P3) encoding.</p>
		<p>To the standard TEI tagset, we added three new elements: </p>
		<ul>
			<li class="item">
				<span class="gi">&lt;relations&gt;</span>
			</li>
			<li class="item">
				<span class="gi">&lt;work&gt;</span>
			</li>
			<li class="item">
				<span class="gi">&lt;workparent&gt;</span>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p> In addition, we provided two attributes for <span class="gi">&lt;work&gt;</span>: </p>
		<ul>
			<li class="item">
				<span class="att">@entity</span>
			</li>
			<li class="item">
				<span class="att">@cert</span>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p> More recently, we have used <span class="att">@ref</span> in place of <span class="att"
			>@entity</span>.</p>
		<p>These elements and attributes are deployed as follows. </p>
		<p><span class="gi">&lt;relations&gt;</span> is used as a container element for <span
			class="gi">&lt;work&gt;</span>. It can appear in two contexts: </p>
		<ul>
			<li class="item">immediately after the <span class="gi">&lt;TEI&gt;</span> root element
				(before <span class="gi">&lt;teiHeader&gt;</span>)</li>
			<li class="item">immediately after <span class="gi">&lt;div&gt;</span> or <span
				class="gi">&lt;lg&gt;</span>.</li>
		</ul>
		<p><span class="gi">&lt;work&gt;</span> is contained within <span class="gi"
			>&lt;relations&gt;</span>. It may contain <span class="gi">&lt;p&gt;</span>, in cases
			where the encoder wishes to explain, in prose, the nature of the connection between the
			present text and the specified work, the evidence for his or her assertion, and/or the
			part of the present text for which the assertion is being made.</p>
		<p><span class="gi">&lt;relations&gt;</span> and <span class="gi">&lt;work&gt;</span>
			elements before <span class="gi">&lt;teiHeader&gt;</span> assert relationships between
			the entirety of the transcribed text contained in the file. When used within <span
			class="gi">&lt;div&gt;</span> or <span class="gi">&lt;lg&gt;</span>, they assert
			relationshps for only that part of the transcription.</p>
		<p>A TEI file is created to represent each work for which there are textual instances. These
			work files contain no transcriptions. Instead, the <span class="gi">&lt;body&gt;</span>
			comprises a prose description (in a series of <span class="gi">&lt;p&gt;</span>
			elements) of the evolution of the work, through the various extant (or imagined)
			instances. This file may also contain, within its own <span class="gi"
			>&lt;relations&gt;</span> element after <span class="gi">&lt;TEI&gt;</span>, the <span
			class="gi">&lt;workparent&gt;</span> element, whose <span class="att">@entity</span>
			attribute indicates the work of which this present work is a part.</p>
		<p>In the sample files provided, uva.00257.xml represents a manuscript transcription. Since
			the entire manuscript is considered an instance of "The Sleepers," the <span class="gi"
			>&lt;relations&gt;</span> and <span class="gi">&lt;work&gt;</span> elements occur just
			after the root <span class="gi">&lt;TEI&gt;</span> element. The <span class="att"
			>@ref</span> points to the work file for "The Sleepers" (xxx.00264.xml). In
			loc.00141.xml, only a part of the transcription is considered an instance of "The
			Sleepers," so the <span class="gi">&lt;relations&gt;</span> and <span class="gi"
			>&lt;work&gt;</span> elements are placed within the appropriate <span class="gi"
			>&lt;div&gt;</span> and <span class="gi">&lt;lg&gt;</span> elements. As in the other
			file, <span class="att">@ref</span> points to the work file for "The Sleepers." The work
			file itself contains a detailed prose narrative. It also gives two titles: the one by
			which the work is most commonly known and a uniform version of the same, for use in
			indexing. The <span class="gi">&lt;relations&gt;</span> and <span class="gi"
			>&lt;workparent&gt;</span> elements specify that the present work, "The Sleepers," is
			part of the larger work <span style="font-style: italic">Leaves of Grass,</span> which
			has the ID "xxx.00001."</p>
