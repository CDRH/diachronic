         <p>The system that the Whitman Archive worked out to indicate relationships among various instances of a given work was developed in 2000 and 2001, just as we were beginning to do TEI (P3) encoding.</p>
<p>To the standard TEI tagset, we added three new elements:
<list>
<item><gi>relations</gi></item>
<item><gi>work</gi></item>
<item><gi>workparent</gi></item>
</list>
In addition, we provided two attributes for <gi>work</gi>:
<list>
<item>
<att>entity</att>
<att>cert</att>
</item>
</list>
</p>
<p>
These elements and attributes are deployed as follows.
</p>
<p>
<gi>relations</gi> is used as a container element for <gi>work</gi>. It can appear in two contexts: 
<list>
<item>immediately after the <gi>TEI</gi> root element (before <gi>teiHeader</gi>);</item>
<item>immediately after <gi>div</gi> or <gi>lg</gi>.</item>
</list>
</p>
<p><gi>work</gi> is contained within <gi>relations</gi>. It may contain <gi>p</gi>, in cases where the encoder wishes to explain, in prose, the nature of the connection between the present text and the specified work, the evidence for his or her assertion, and/or the part of the present text for which the assertion is being made.</p>

<p>
<gi>relations</gi> and <gi>work</gi> elements before <gi>teiHeader</gi> assert relationships between the entirety of the transcribed text contained in the file. When used within <gi>div</gi> or <gi>lg</gi>, they assert relationshps for only that part of the transcription.
</p>

<p>A TEI file is created to represent each work for which there are textual instances. These work files contain no transcriptions. Instead, the <gi>body</gi> comprises a prose description (in a series of <gi>p</gi> elements) of the evolution of the work, through the various extant (or imagined) instances. This file may also contain, within its own <gi>relations</gi> element after <gi>TEI</gi>, the <gi>workparent</gi> element, whose <att>entity</att> attribute indicates the work of which this present work is a part.</p>

<p>
In the sample files provided, uva.00257.xml represents a manuscript transcription. Since the entire manuscript is considered an instance of "The Sleepers," the <gi>relations</gi> and <gi>work</gi> elements occur just after the root <gi>TEI</gi> element. The <att>ref</att> points to the work file for "The Sleepers" (xxx.00264.xml). In loc.00141.xml, only a part of the transcription is considered an instance of "The Sleepers," so the <gi>relations</gi> and <gi>work</gi> elements are placed within the appropriate <gi>div</gi> and <gi>lg</gi> elements. As in the other file, <att>ref</att> points to the work file for "The Sleepers." The work file itself contains a detailed prose narrative. It also gives two titles: the one by which the work is most commonly known and a uniform version of the same, for use in indexing. The <gi>relations</gi> and <gi>workparent</gi> elements specify that the present work, "The Sleepers," is part of the larger work <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass,</hi> which has the ID "xxx.00001."
